Subject: Request for Every.org Partner Webhook Integration

Dear Every.org Partners Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm working on an application called Stash, where we're integrating charitable donations through Every.org's API. Our platform allows users to donate to nonprofits and receive premium membership benefits in return, encouraging philanthropic engagement.

Based on your documentation, I understand that you offer webhook functionality for partners. I'd like to request a webhook_token for our application with the following details:

Use Case:
- Stash is a platform that encourages users to donate to nonprofits in exchange for premium access
- When a user donates ($10+ for 1 month of premium access and 300 coins), we need to verify the donation was completed
- We're currently using your Partners API (donation/checkout endpoint) to create donations

Webhook Endpoint:
[YOUR_PRODUCTION_URL]/api/webhooks/every-org

Technical Information:
- We've already implemented the webhook handler with signature verification
- We're using your live API key: pk_live_02333698046d5c112c32edb88a595316
- Our implementation properly validates webhook signatures

Please let me know if you need any additional information to process this request. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to enhancing our integration with Every.org.

Thank you,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR CONTACT INFO]
