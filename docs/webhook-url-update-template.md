# Webhook URL Update Template for Every.org

## Email Subject: 
Updated Webhook URL for Stash Integration Testing (Staging Environment)

## Email Body:
Hello,

I'm writing to provide an updated webhook URL for the Stash integration with Every.org's staging environment. Our previous webhook URL needs to be replaced with the following:

```
https://9662-98-207-86-33.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/every-org
```

Since we're using ngrok for development testing, the URL changes each time we restart our development environment. We appreciate your assistance in updating this URL in your staging environment.

The updated URL is now active and ready to receive webhook notifications from your staging environment.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Stash Development Team
