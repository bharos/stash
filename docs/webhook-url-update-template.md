# Webhook URL Update Template for Every.org

## Email Subject: 
Stable Webhook URL for Stash Integration Testing (Staging Environment)

## Email Body:
Hello,

I'm writing to provide a stable webhook URL for the Stash integration with Every.org's staging environment. Please use the following URL for webhook notifications:

```
https://staging.stashdb.fyi/api/webhooks/every-org
```

This is now a permanent staging URL that will not change, so it can be used reliably for all future webhook testing between our systems.

The updated URL is now active and ready to receive webhook notifications from your staging environment.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Stash Development Team
